ðŸ“„ Project Summary: Exploratory Data Analysis on CardioGoodFitness Dataset
ðŸ”Ž Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the CardioGoodFitness dataset, which contains customer data collected by a fitness equipment company. The primary objective of this analysis is to understand customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and demographic insights that influence product preferences.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Description
The CardioGoodFitness dataset includes information about customers who have purchased treadmills from the company. The dataset contains variables such as:

Product - Type of treadmill purchased (TM195, TM498, TM798)
Age - Customer's age
Gender - Male or Female
Education - Years of education completed
Marital Status - Single or Married
Usage - Average number of times the customer uses the treadmill per week
Fitness - Self-reported fitness level (scale from 1 to 5)
Income - Annual income of the customer
Miles - Average weekly miles run on the treadmill
ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Understand the demographic profile of customers.
Analyze product preferences based on gender, age, and income.
Study the relationship between income levels and product choice.
Identify patterns in fitness levels, treadmill usage, and weekly miles.
Use colorful and visually appealing graphs to make insights clear and engaging.
ðŸ”¬ Key Analyses Performed
Customer Demographics Analysis: Gender distribution, age distribution, income segmentation.
Product Preference Insights: Comparing product choices across income groups, fitness levels, and genders.
Behavioral Insights: Weekly usage and miles covered across product types.
Correlation Analysis: Heatmap to study relationships between numerical variables like age, income, fitness, and miles.
Advanced Visualizations: Combination of pie charts, bar charts, violin plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps using Seaborn and Matplotlib, with a focus on using vibrant and colorful visuals.
ðŸš€ Outcome
This comprehensive analysis helps the company:

Identify target customer segments for each product.
Understand what influences treadmill purchases (age, income, fitness level, etc.).
Develop data-driven marketing strategies for different customer groups.
ðŸŒˆ Why This Project Stands Out
Focus on both analytical depth and visual appeal.
Use of colorful plots to enhance clarity and engagement.
Easy-to-understand insights, suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences.
